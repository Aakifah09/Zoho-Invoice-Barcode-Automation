TSC TTP-244 Pro Calibration
Critical: Gap Detection and Calibration
The printer uses gap detection technology to identify label spacing. Proper calibration ensures correct label feeding and prevents misalignment.
Hardware Calibration Method (Recommended)
Step 1: Access Calibration Mode
1. Power OFF the printer completely
2. Locate the FEED button on the printer control panel
3. While holding FEED button, press the POWER button
4. Keep holding FEED until you see LED indicators change (3-5 seconds)
5. Release both buttons
6. Printer enters gap detection mode


Step 2: Load Label Stock

1. Open the media cover
2. Insert 50mm × 25mm label roll
3. Align labels with the thermal head
4. Close the media cover
5. Ensure labels feed smoothly without resistance


Step 3: Execute Gap Detection

1. Printer will automatically feed labels
2. Detects gaps between label rows
3. Process completes when LED stops flashing (10-15 seconds)
4. Printer returns to normal mode


Print Preferences Configuration (Windows)

Critical Gap Settings:
Gap Height: 2-3mm
- Most thermal printers use 2-3mm gaps between labels
- Gap detection automatically finds this value
- If manual entry required: Start with 2mm, adjust up if labels misalign

Feed Adjustment: 0mm (standard)
- Use if labels are misfeeding
- Increase incrementally (+0.2mm) if gaps appear
- Decrease if labels overlap
Calibration Troubleshooting


Issue: Printer Won't Enter Calibration Mode

Solution:
1. Ensure printer is completely powered off
2. Wait 5 seconds before attempting again
3. Try with different USB cable/port
4. Check if drivers are properly installed
5. Restart computer and retry


Issue: Gap Detection Fails

Solution:
1. Ensure label roll is properly aligned
2. Check for dust or debris on sensor
3. Clean the media sensor with dry cloth (gently)
4. Try with fresh label roll
5. If persistent: Contact TSC support


Issue: Labels Feed Inconsistently

Solution:
1. Re-run gap detection calibration
2. Adjust gap height: Try 2.5mm if using 3mm
3. Verify label stock matches specifications
4. Check for wrinkled or damaged labels
5. Ensure roller is clean and not sticky
